# Amazon-Clone
Amazon Clone Project
I developed an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS to replicate the design and layout of the popular e-commerce platform. This project includes:

A responsive and visually appealing homepage.
Product sections styled to mimic Amazon's interface.
A user-friendly layout focusing on clear structure and aesthetics.
The primary goal of this project was to test and refine my skills, applying what I’ve learned in web development so far. It allowed me to practice building responsive designs and replicating real-world layouts.

As a student exploring web development, I’m constantly learning and implementing new concepts. Currently, I’m diving into JavaScript, APIs, and advanced frameworks to expand my skill set and enhance the functionality of similar projects in the future.
